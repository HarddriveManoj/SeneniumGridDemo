  @SmokeTest
  Scenario Outline: Create a test automation script for Wishlist demo
    Given I am on the WestwingNow home page
    When I search for "<product>"
    Then I should see product listing page with a list of products
    When I click on wishlist icon of the first found product
    Then I should see the login/registration overlay
    When I switch to login form of the overlay
    And I log in with "<user>" credentials
    Then the product should be added to the wishlist
    And I go to the wishlist page
    And I delete the product from my wishlist
    Examples:
      | product | user                  |
